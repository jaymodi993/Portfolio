        Hello! I'm Jay Modi, a passionate web developer eager to embark on a
        journey in the ever-evolving world of technology. With a fresh
        perspective and a hunger to learn, I am excited to contribute my
        skills and creativity to innovative projects.
        <br /><br />
        My fascination with web development began from College where I
        made a project on a hospital management system. Since then, I've been
        on a quest to expand my knowledge and refine my craft. I have
        hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have dabbled in
        various frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap.
        <br /><br />
        What truly drives me is the opportunity to solve problems and create
        seamless user experiences. I thrive in collaborative environments,
        where I can brainstorm ideas and turn them into tangible solutions.
        <br /><br />
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to
        connecting with you!
        <br /><br />
